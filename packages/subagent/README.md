# subagent/ — subagent capability family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The subagent package family lets an agent delegate a task to a child, continue the child's work, and discover every child it created. Choose a fresh in-process child for isolated work under any mounted harness, a history-seeded in-process child when prior conversation matters, or a process-isolated Harness child through the TypeScript SDK. Model-facing tools also let agents message adjacent agents, interrupt work, and list child status. Each child remains visible to its parent whether it is running or stored; the package READMEs document provider-specific setup and limits.
